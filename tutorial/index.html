<h1>BGT HTML Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Why HTML?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Explain briefly how the internet works and what HTML documents are used for</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Web</h3>

<p>In order to understand HTML documents, it’s worth getting a basic understanding of how the web works. The web links documents to each other by using the infrastructure of the internet (the two should not be confused). These documents are stored on computers called servers and can be accessed by visiting the servers location through a web browser.</p>

<p>For example, when you visit google.com in your web browser, your computer (client) is asking a server which has the google.com document to send you a copy. You then download that document to your web browser in order for you to see and interact with the page (search bar, links etc).</p>

<p>This is why HTML is so important, it is the bedrock of the web.</p>

<h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>

<p>These documents are written in HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, which is used to structure and describe the content of your webpage. There are a number of HTML tags that you can use to structure and describe your content. For example, you’d use the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag to indicate that whatever is inside this tag is the name of your site. More on that in the <em>Let’s Build</em> section.</p>

<p>Websites are built up of HTML tags containing content.</p>

<h2>First Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>include any set up here</li>
</ul>

<p>So you’re probably wondering “how do I make a HTML document” or have wondered how to make a website. It’s less complicated than you think:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On your computer create a folder and name it <code>my_site</code> (or something else, the name doesn’t matter)</li>
	<li>Inside this folder create a file called <code>index.html</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is your HTML document. Open this file in Chrome, Firefox or your web browser of choice. You’ll see a blank page, because you haven’t put any content into it yet, but this is essentially what you’ll get when you visit any other page on the web.</p>
